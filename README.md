## Game Description
You wake up in a steel room, with a door and no real other features. A robot suddenly speaks to you and tours you around the strange bunker. Once you're on your own, things begin to change in weird ways, plants and life growing in unusual places, rooms shifting and morphing. 

All the while, the robot starts growing more vague, almost taken over by something else. You must find a way to escape.
